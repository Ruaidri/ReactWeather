This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to access international weather data and descriptions. Google maps API is used in conjunction with this to locate the area the user is searching. A video tutorial was used; Using APIs in React - Create a Weather Application, to create the initial application, but several features were implemented over the given tutorial.
The front end is styled using Bootstrap CSS.
